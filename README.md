## Tips
-The Current Build does not have a strict ending. The last platform contains 4 bad dudes. If you've killed them congrats you've beaten the test level.

## Installation
1. **Download Game**:  Click on View Code,then select the APK file. On the next screen, there is a roughly 20mb file with the three dots next to it. Select those and press download. 
2. **Adjust security settings**: By default, Android devices are set to block the installation of APKs from unknown sources for security reasons. To enable the installation, follow these steps:

   - Open the "Settings" menu on your Android device.
   - Look for the "Security" or "Privacy" section.
   - Within that section, find the option called "Unknown sources" or "Install unknown apps".
   - Tap on it, and you may be presented with a list of apps or a toggle switch to allow installations from unknown sources. Enable this option.

3. **Locate the APK file**: Open your device's file manager or a dedicated file explorer app. Navigate to the folder where the downloaded APK file is saved. It's usually located in the "Downloads" folder or the folder you specified during the download process.

4. **Begin the installation**: Tap on the APK file to start the installation process. A prompt may appear asking for confirmation to install the app. Read the permissions and information displayed on the screen to ensure you trust the source, and then tap on the "Install" button.

5. **Complete the installation**: The installation process will begin, and you may see a progress bar or a message indicating that the app is being installed. Once the installation is complete, you'll usually see an "Open" button. You can choose to open the app right away or access it later through your device's app launcher or home screen.

6. **Disable unknown sources (optional)**: After installation, it's recommended to disable the option to install apps from unknown sources to maintain the security of your device. To disable it, follow these steps:

   - Go back to the device's settings.
   - Locate the "Unknown sources" or "Install unknown apps" option.
   - Disable the option to prevent future installations from unknown sources.
